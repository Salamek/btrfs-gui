btrfs-gui
=========

This is a GUI tool for managing btrfs filesystems. It can scan,
display, and manage btrfs-specific operations on btrfs filesystems
either on the local machine, or on a remote one (via ssh).

The application requires the use of python 3.x for the GUI, and can
run the root-level helper using python 2.x (python 3.x version coming
shortly).
