btrfs-gui
=========

This is a GUI tool for managing btrfs filesystems. It can scan,
display, and manage btrfs-specific operations on btrfs filesystems
either on the local machine, or on a remote one (via ssh).

The application requires the use of python 3.x for the GUI, and can
run the root-level helper using python 2.x or python 3.x.

More information, and the latest version, can be found from the
project's web pages at http://carfax.org.uk/btrfs-gui/

Installation
============

$ sudo python3 setup.py install

If you need to install the helper script on a server, without
installing the GUI components:

$ sudo python setup-helper.py install
